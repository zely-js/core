v1.0 has been released. ðŸŽ‰

Compared to v0 and v1, many features have been added.
In this post, I will introduce what has changed and how to migrate from v0 to v1.

## Major Changes

I'll start by talking about the major changes.

### Return

In this update, we thought about how users can use zely more easily and simply.

We found that printing a simple `hello world` required a lot of code.

```ts
export function get(req, res) {
  res.send('hello world');
}
```

Now all you have to do is `return`.

```ts
export function get() {
  return 'hello world';
}
```

However, the code you just showed is also longer than expected.
So let's work some magic to make it shorter. ðŸ”®

### Methods

You can now response to requests simpler.

```ts
export default {
  message: 'hello',
};
```

But just `export default {}` responds to all requests. If you want to run only when the method is post:

```ts
import { GET } from 'zely/methods';

export default GET({
  /* data */
});
```

## Migrate from v0

Code written in `v0` will work in `v1` without any special code modifications.  
But let's replace the `v0` code with the `v1` style.

::: code-group

```ts [v1]
import { GET } from 'zely/methods';

export default GET({
  message: 'hello world',
});
```

```ts [v0]
export function get(req, res) {
  res.send({ message: 'hello world' });
}
```
