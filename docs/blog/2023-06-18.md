Zely repository has been moved!  
Check out our new repository! - **[zely-js/core](https://github.com/zely-js/core)**

## But, why?

There will be more packages with various updates in the future. But the more it does, the bigger the zely monorepo will be.  
To solve this problem, we created an organization called [zely-js](https://github.com/zely-js). And we will publish some packages within it.
